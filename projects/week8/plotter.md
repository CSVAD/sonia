### Coming Undone & Together again

I don't know why exactly but I thought this was the most challenging assignment of the course. I think plotters create visual interest when they replicate natural forms in a way that is only possible using a machine (e.g. a hand drawn figure precisely repeated) or when they simulate a natural form using very precise geometric primitives (e.g. Jennifer's fern drawings from her natural images series).

*What new challenges or constraints did the plotter add when creating computational art and design?*

My greatest concern with using the plotter was achieving something that was different that what could be done with a printer. I wanted the medium to be discernible but at the same time I wanted the effect to be subtle. My idea was to reuse a simple primitive and combine it in interesting ways. However, I found that many results looked too cluttered -- I liked the simplicity of using a fine tip pen (if you look closely you can see the line thickness vary -- the lines are thinner than the vertices but the difference is smooth. One way I made this more apparent was by using a faster speed).

I had two failed experiments. I wanted to use the brush pen to create a dragged painterly effect. However, the brush added curvature to the triangles (see below) that undermined the intention of the piece and it just didn't work well. I also tried to use pencil. I wanted to erase and shade parts of triangles in an inconsistent manner (so there would not be clear consistent overlap in any direction). However, the pencil was extremely faint and it was difficult to match lightness of the stroke during shading.

*What new expressive opportunities (if any) did the plotter offer over screen-based output?*

I'm actually very happy with my result. I perturbed the paper while the plotter was moving. This added meaning & interest in my work. I think more time to explore would have been great.
