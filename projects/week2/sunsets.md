### Sunsets

For this week's repetition based project, I wanted to do something that captures the rhythm of each day. So I chose to focus on the sun setting in Santa Barbara. I was also thinking of Aten, the representation of the sun as the divine from Egyptian mythology, that is quite striking (Atenism was a monothestic religion practiced by Amehotep IV and his family and abolished in a subsequent reign). Aten is represented by a disc with outstretched rays where each ray ends in a hand. Because I think the Aten is marvelous visually and symbolically, I created a variation of this symbol to use as my tiling form. There is variation in the orientation of the hands, and although it is a subtle effect, they rotate in my final pattern. Also, the rays create a partial grid indicating 90 degree and 45 degree directions that are counterbalanced by the round discs in the tiles and background. In the background, I used rows of spheres. They are scaled in both size and opacity as a function of y. The blue value of the color -- the base is an orange -- also fluctuates using a sine function based on the y value of each row. Scaling is done by changing both the tiling and sphere size. I created two series -- one with the Aten tiles in white and another with them in blue.
