## Final Project Proposal

### I. Globals

I'm not sure if this undermines some of the intended functionality of Processing but as stated in Bret Victor's critique, the use of global state limits the "tinkerability" of processing. Not only is it difficult to quickly refactor code, but it also limits the ability to combine code from different sources. I think I could write a library designed to make some attributes, like color, stroke, and transformations attached to specific objects and change the way that they are innately handled.

### II. Halftone Printing

I think it would be possible and interesting to write a library that simulates halftone printing in processing. Several parameters could be exposed to the end user to customize the appearance of their final project.

### III. Behavior

I would like to create an event focused library to change the way that events are treated to more naturally simulate behavior. I think gestures and reactions should be added to objects and that it would be possible to write a library to help achieve this goal.

E.g. fish.addGesture('r', swimBackwards);

Another idea is to simply create a way to quickly add "creatures" and reactions to other creatures in the space (along with collison detection, movements etc). This could be a large interactive system.

### IV. Visualized Reactions to Sound

This project would be a generative series. I would like to invite people to participate in creating each piece. Each one would be a reaction to a particular set of sounds. For my week 5 project, my goal was to create a drawing tool where both the tool and artist respond to sound. I think I could refine the mappings to better match sound to the visual aspect of the end result and expand the tool beyond its current limitations (right now it only uses radials). The idea of creating an interface where people are able to feel and express themselves using their hands is another motivation for this project.
