> Doing with Images makes Symbols

> of course it had a "user interface," but one that repelled end users instead of drawing them closer to the hearth

> The best way to predict the future is to invent it!


One thing that struck me about this reading was how multifaceted Kay's references leading up to his work are -- they range from education and psychology to the humanities, and each component was necessary for him to synthesize his key idea. I think this is a strong case in favor of multidisciplinary and multimodal research.

Also, is it possible to design tools in a way that we're aware of how they will impact us?

### "Instrumental Interaction: An Interaction Model for Designing Post-WIMP User Interfaces" by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon

> The Instrumental Interaction model is based on how we naturally use tools (or instruments) to manipulate objects of interest in the physical world. Objects of interest are called domain objects, and are manipulated with computer artifacts called interaction instruments.

This brought to mind my experience of working on a domain specific language for dance. I focused so entirely on the components describing the model and deciding beforehand by collaborating with dancers what would good and bad (in that sense my design was prescriptive, not generative). I was fortunate to have a consultation with the Center for Digital Humanities where I met a UX designer who helped me brainstorm different ideas regarding interaction design. I think reading this paper beforehand would have been immensely helpful. When designing any system, it's critical to think of what comprise the domain objects as opposed to interaction instruments or how a user activates instruments. These should be effectively decomposed in a way that is immediately usable and intuitive for the user. 

### "Alternative Programming Interfaces for Alternative Programmers" by Toby Schachman

- cold, computer as other -- ecosystems around programming (github, online communities) --> teletype

- nonlinear workflows

- programming (designing a system) and authoring --> two classes of programmers, are users of photoshop programmers?

- directly manipulable interfaces and experimentation --> vs. strict specification

- what is the extent of expressivity achievable by a given tool? maybe that should be predefined
