> Doing with Images makes Symbols

> of course it had a "user interface," but one that repelled end users instead of drawing them closer to the hearth

> The best way to predict the future is to invent it!


One thing that struck me about this reading was how multifaceted Kay's references leading up to his work are -- they range from childhood development and cognitive science to the humanities, and each component was necessary for him to synthesize his key idea. I think this is a strong case in favor of multidisciplinary and multimodal research.

McLuhan's *Understanding Media* that theorizes to convey a message effectively in a medium or understand it the user has to internalize it to the extent where they can separate out the message itself really resonated with me. Whenever I'm trying to work with a new system or set of tools there is always this process which feels like grappling until I achieve a certain degree of fluency. I was also reminded of the discussion of focused reasoning and free association from "Symbols" from *Abstracting Craft* by Malcom McCullough: there are different modes in which we can operate and symbolic systems help us navigate between them. Kay captures this "because none of the mentalities is supremely useful to the exclusion of the others, the best strategy would be to try to gently force synergy between them in the user interface design" (128). Also, I am curious -- is it possible to design tools in a way that we're aware of how they will impact us? Even with the extent of the consideration behind Kay's "Doing with Images makes Symbols" is it possible to understand how a medium will affect us before we've internalized it?

### "Instrumental Interaction: An Interaction Model for Designing Post-WIMP User Interfaces" by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon

> The Instrumental Interaction model is based on how we naturally use tools (or instruments) to manipulate objects of interest in the physical world. Objects of interest are called domain objects, and are manipulated with computer artifacts called interaction instruments.

This brought to mind my experience of working on a domain specific language for dance. I focused so entirely on the components describing the model and deciding beforehand by collaborating with dancers what would good and bad (in that sense my design was prescriptive, not generative). I was fortunate to have a consultation with the Center for Digital Humanities where I met a UX designer who helped me brainstorm different ideas regarding interaction design. I think reading this paper beforehand would have been immensely helpful. When designing any system, it's critical to think of what comprise the domain objects as opposed to interaction instruments or how a user activates instruments. These should be effectively decomposed in a way that is immediately usable and intuitive for the user.

### "Alternative Programming Interfaces for Alternative Programmers" by Toby Schachman

- cold, computer as other -- ecosystems around programming (github, online communities) --> teletype

I appreciated Schachman's distinction between cold computation and the more organic communities now emerging around computing. For instance, one tool I'm interested in using more is teletype which lets developers collaborate on their cold in real time (in my editor of choice). I somewhat disagree with his claim that traditional programming is always a linear workflow moving towards a set specification. More often than not I think there's a moving target which becomes clearer through trial and experimentation and fundamentally requires iterative exploration. I think it was also notable that Schachman suggested a drawback of Recursive Drawing, a directly manipulable interface, was that it was almost too easy to experiment as opposed to working towards a predetermined goal. I also think the boundary between programming and authoring is tenuous at best. Perhaps, programmers of a system should try to delineate its degree of expressivity. Also I think everyone starts out as an alternative programmer -- I am not sure why there is an instance on making a distinction between traditional and nontraditional programming communities -- perhaps overtime it will be more natural to have more endpoints exposed where people are programming in many facets of their lives and achieve a greater proficiency in multiple media as a result.
