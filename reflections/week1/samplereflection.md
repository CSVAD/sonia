## This is a sample reflection! 

Write **one to two paragraphs** about your reactions and thoughts to the weekly reading. In what ways did you agree or dissagree with the points raised by the author? What associations did it raise for you? How did it align with or diverge from your personal experience? Feel free to include [links](http://formandcode.com/) to other relevant readings, videos, or works in your reflection.

The reflections can be written in Markdown. Here's some tips on how to get started: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown).
