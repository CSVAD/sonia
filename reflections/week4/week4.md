### Closed Systems: Generative Art & Software Abstraction by Marius Watz

I think this treatise is exciting because it's a call to innovation in using generative art to produce multimodal and synesthetic work. I am curious to learn more about its circulation and influence.

### Playing a Game of GANstruction by Helena Sarin

Helena Sarin's assessment of GAN based work is surprising because she is critical of it. Yet, during the Q&A session following her talk she answers a question about whether or not GAN artwork falls into the purview of fine art by saying that she does not like debates and if the artist claims for it to be art, then it is. Instead of providing clarifications for me in terms of authorship or ownership regarding generative artworks, that statement obfuscates why there's value in specifically GAN based artwork. I thought her methodology -- using CycleGAN for "superresolution" was interesting and would be fun to explore. I would also like to investigate her #cameraObscura series in more depth. Lastly, her quoting Mary Oliver with respect to training a GAN ("Pay attention. Be astonished. Tell about it.") was curious because it suggests both understanding the process and being caught off-guard by an unexpected result. I am also curious if it would be possible to leverage work like hers -- using creative input and output -- coupled with or in lieu of a presentation of the theory -- to gain a better intuition for how the various GANs she uses work.

### ML Art: An Interview with Memo Akten

I think Memo Akten's focus to create "realtime, interactive closed feedback loops with continuous control" for creators is inspiring. At the same time, I wonder about the expressivity afforded by a system that is pre-defined. I noticed there were unexpected effects created in every piece which were mesmerizing (for instance, the dissonance in "Fight!"). Each piece or series also functioned at many levels. Unlike Sarin's claim that the problem with artwork that only leverages novel piece of technology is that once you get it you get it and it ceases to be interesting, Akten's work is transfixing. Perhaps, this is because most pieces are also reflections on human processes -- i.e. in "Learning to See" the machine only knows what it has already seen and even though it is strikingly limited, the models still create beautiful images.


### The New Role of the Designer in Generative Design Che-Wei Wang (CW&T)

"Generative Design + Neural Networks + Natural Language Processing"

Che-Wei Wang’s message that the designer needs to un-blackbox generative design to create systems and orchestrate interactions between people and technology was resonant. At the same time, he advocated for a vision where the process of design is abstracted away from the user — e.g. you could swipe through examples of “comfy chairs” matching your personal aesthetic. I wonder — are these views contradictory? What if instead people are able to quickly iterate / modify / fork design systems to immediately serve their needs?

His discussion of the ramifications of pervasive generative design including “creepy” design and weaponized design was also thought-provoking. Is there a way to limit the consequences of or regulate design in a meaningful way without restricting innovation?
