### "Reflections on Designing Construction Kits for Kids" by Mitchel Resnick and Brian Silverman

> "we believe the best learning experiences, for most people, come when they are actively engaged in designing and creating things, especially things that are meaningful to them or others around them"

> "When we observe users repeatedly making the same 'mistake' with a prototype, we sometimes are able to revise the software so that it behaves in the way that users had expected

- Microworlds for exploring ideas (emergence)

While the principles laid out in detail by the authors are clear and helpful to go through individually, I think the main idea can be summarized in one word "tinkerability." All of their principles augment the degree to which this is possible with their systems -- from rapid prototyping and iterating on their designs to having low floors and wide walls. The one idea that seems to diverge most from this goal and possibly exists in its own categories is to "make powerful ideas salient -- not forced." The authors describe creating microworlds to explore complex ideas that become implicitly understood through navigating or building within that world. I think this is a very useful way to think about designing frameworks -- the ultimate realization of any medium is that it changes the way you think -- and will do my best to apply it to my work.

I also find their approach to dealing with plateaus to be inspiring. They state much can be learned at one of these plateaus, so it is important to make sure that a lot can be done at the stage that kids seem to be able to reach. In other words, there needs to be enough room for expression and exploration to avoid ennui. At the same time this permits greater learning than one might initially be able to discern given the lack of rapid progress in the style or complexity of work.  

### "Learnable Programming" by Bret Victor

> "Programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill"

> "'Create-by-abstracting' is about writing code for a specific case, then generalizing it."

This essay makes concrete points about defining and improving programming to create systems that are more effective in facilitating and driving expression. However, while I agree with most of Bret Victor's points, there are some aspects of this essay that I think are somewhat dubious. To begin with points of agreement, I think it's critical to show data, comparisons and minimize hidden state. In particular, I'm doing more work in ML these days (for a course and personal project) and find that it's very hard to understand the flow of information through my system and why one architecture works better than another. I think effective visualizations would go a long way towards demystifying ML and bring more people to the table.

Turning to my primary point of contention, Victor claims that working the in the head doesn't scale. I agree that at some point things need to be written out and experimented with but at the same time there are amazing systems that have arisen from traditional modes of programming. I think there is infrastructure that individuals or organizations use to facilitate that process and bringing those into a programming environment might make those results more widely achievable. That said, I'm not sure about the extent to which the degree of visualizations and support Victor advocates for are possible in more abstract contexts. I think it would be very cumbersome especially outside of a strictly visual environment to specify tangible visualizations for each line of code.

In terms of what constitutes programming, I agree with his assessment that the crux of programming is abstracting thought. Again, I felt conflicted about the example with the house -- it really seems like the programmer has to know what she's doing to be able to execute using the system suggested, but I think some intentional design that contributes to support showing flow and internalizing it would be helpful. In particular, I think explaining in context and making meaning transparent are general principles that should be applied to any system.

Lastly while I concur with his analysis of Processing in terms of its naming, lack of clarity surrounding parameters, and use of global state that can obstruct abstraction, Processing has such widespread usage. I think it's worth discussing whether or not it does embody a "weak way of thinking" and why it has such widespread adoption.


### "Extending Manual Drawing Practices with Artist-Centric Programming Tools" by Jennifer Jacobs, Joel Brandt, Radomir Mech and Mitchel Resnick

I think there are many interesting aspects to this paper. One that jumped off the page on account of some recent discussions was how DB affected Tritt and McGill's idea about processes and their own art making by expanding or shifting how they think about working with tools. Tritt in particular also mentioned exploring how to create works that are not achievable in any other media which brought to mind Bret Victor's talk "Stop Drawing Dead Fish." The design choices such as the brush implementation and feedback and how they evolved through the course of the project's development and evaluation also indicated that perhaps the most significant challenge of creating tools in any domain is discovering what constitutes a suitable representation or an effective workflow within that context.
