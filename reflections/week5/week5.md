### "Dynamic Pictures Motivation Essay" by Bret Victor

I think the way Bret Victor imagines dynamic pictures is very intriguing. Visualizations that are interactive are more engaging. They also help people internalize information by revealing trends or by facilitating exploration and understanding. I think the biggest bottleneck to realizing a future where dynamic images are prevalent are the tools that people use to consume media. For instance, technical papers are most often distributed as pdfs with static graphs. I think the information would be much better conveyed and disseminated with added interactivity but before there is a distribution mechanism that supports that behavior I think it is implausible. I also think that it must be easy to construct dynamic pictures in order for them to be more pervasive. That is, while I think his point about artist independence is significant, I don't think everyone who wants to create a dynamic figure should necessarily need to be able to create a UI themselves. There should be easy to adopt tools with plenty of scaffolding and examples to help.


### "Stop Drawing Dead Fish" by Bret Victor

I am so curious to learn more about the aftermath of Bret Victor's talk "Stop Drawing Dead Fish." His performance of a fish (part 1 of the talk) responding to stimuli in its environment just seemed like a whole new way to do story-telling. I couldn't help thinking of how artists not only create but also perform their characters. When he discussed the duality between the simulated behavior (i.e. choosing what actions should be encoded versus performed), I thought of how artist's creations often impact their way of looking at the world in turn. Working with behavior as opposed to animation furthers the illusion of life.
